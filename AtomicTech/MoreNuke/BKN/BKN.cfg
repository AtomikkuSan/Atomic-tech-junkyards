// Thanks to Porkjet for providing the original model & texture of this part in
// his Atomic Age mod. I've significantly tweaked the stats and behavior, turning
// it into a 1.875m nuclear engine with stats scaled appropriately. It's balanced
// very differently from how Porkjet set it up in Atomic Age.
//
// Thank you, too, to JadeOfMaar, and very kindly stepped up to provide a new
// implementation of the exhaust plume (Porkjet's original didn't fit well with
// my rescaled/rebalanced version of the engine, and it was for an older version
// of Unity, which made it hard to work with.)

	manufacturer = AtomicTech Inc.
	description = The Closed Cycle Gas-Core design overcomes the limits of Solid Core NTR's by deliberately letting the Reactor melt and vaporize, reaching much higher core temperatures and exhaust velocities, which grants this rocket exceptional ISP in the 1750s. No radioactive material leaves the engine though, the vaporized nuclear hellfire is safely confined within seven astonishingly fragile transparent quartz bulbs, which let most of the thermal radiation through to the propellant and are the reason for its lovely name. A sophisticated system of active cooling and a steady vortex stream of Xenon Gas around the fissioning nuclear plasma that keeps it from touching the walls prevent the quartz bulbs from spontaneously vaporizing. Actually yes, it does sound kind of scary, but as with everything in life, the coolness of things is directly proportional to their danger.

  //'ly proportional to their danger.
