	title = AT-TREL "GIGACHAD" Large Toroidal Gas Core Thermonuclear Rocket Engine
	manufacturer = AtomicTech Inc.
	description = The Closed Cycle Gas-Core design overcomes the limits of Solid Core NTR's by deliberately letting the Reactor melt and vaporize, reaching much higher core temperatures and exhaust velocities, which grants this rocket an enoromous ISP of 3100s. No radioactive material leaves the engine though, the vaporized nuclear material is safely confined within a series of toroidal quartz chambers, which let most of the thermal radiation through to the propellant and prevent it from wrecking havoc of the rest of the machinery. A sophisticated system of active cooling and a steady vortex stream of Xenon Gas around the fissioning nuclear plasma that keeps it from touching the walls prevent the quartz bulbs from spontaneously vaporizing. This engine is at the cutting edge of interplanetary transfer vehicles and is exceptionally expensive. The insane size of the engine makes it particularly dangerous and must be handled with immense care while managing its intense levels of heat production. The concept sounds particularly dangerous, but as with everything in life, the awesomeness of things is directly proportional to their amount of danger.
