  manufacturer = AtomicTech Inc.
  description = Originally built and designed as part of the Orbital Launch System, a replacement for the aging Dyna-Wing MK II and Dyna-Soar MK III spacecraft, countless delays forced RS Capsuledyne to open orders for the Taurus HCV Command Pod to the orbital launch services marketplace as a whole, not just for the builders of the OLS. After a few years, RS Capsuledyne went out of business and its assets were scattered. Eventually,their prized Taurus eventually fell into the hands of AtomicTech Inc. where the design was upgraded and put back into production. It quickly became one of the most popular 3.75 Meter Command Pods despite its lack of built in Launch Escape System.
