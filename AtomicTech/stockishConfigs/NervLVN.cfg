  @description = "Built off of the architecture of the LV-N, the AT-TREL "NERVO" Solid Core Thermonuclear Rocket Engine is an update to the beloved LV-N. The name comes from AtomicTech Inc.'s Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Operations Program that later was reformed into the world-famous Thermonuclear Rocket Engine Laboratory. The NERVO offers 841 seconds of ISP in a vacuum and a greatly enhanced 500 seconds of ISP at Kerbin's atmospheric sea level. It also offers in intergrated thermonuclear electric generator to put the NERVO's reactor core to good use. The future is glowing bright, now with an Alternator and better efficiency!"
